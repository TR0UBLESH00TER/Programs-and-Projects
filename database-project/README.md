*Student Data Management System is a project made for educational institutions to store their student data. It does various operations like:*
-	*Accepting and storing a student‚Äôs data,*
-	*Displaying existing records of students,*
-	*Deleting unnecessary records,*
-	*Updating existing records,*
-	*Searching of a particular student‚Äôs data,*
-	*And even exporting data into a CSV file!*

*This project is an integration of tkinter (A Standard Library of Python), [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) and [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) which is able to accept student's data from a user friendly GUI (tkinter), process it (python) and store it at the backend (MySQL database) and is divided into two programs: `setup.py` and `main.py`.*

<br /> ‚úî Run `setup.py` first i.e., before running any other file.
<br /> <br /> ‚úî `main.py` is the main file which you should run only after running setup.py
<br /> <br /> 

üéâ **Advantage:**<br />
This project is useful for those people who have no idea about MySQL and sql commands and can be used by them to store and manipulate data.


> ##### ‚Ñπ `main_v1.py` is older version of main.py.
>The difference is in the way they display data. `main_v1.py` uses Entry widget to display data which wasn't much convenient plus there was no y-scroll!! (*OMG no y-scroll?! Not good for large amout of records* &nbsp;&nbsp;(TT_TT)&nbsp;) and `main.py` uses Treeview widget which is more convenient and there's a y-scroll! (*yay now I can see large amount of records!*)

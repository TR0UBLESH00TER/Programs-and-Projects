### Database Management System using Python and MySQL
Requirements:
- Python
- MySQL
- Tkinter
- mysql-connector

This is a simple program that do some operations like Displaying Data, Accepting Student Data, Deleting Data and Updating Data. It also generates csv file for the existing data.
<br /><br /> Run `setup.py` first i.e., before running any other file.
<br /> <br /> `main.py` is the main file which you should run only after running setup.py
<br /> <br /> `main_v1.py` is older version of main.py. 
<br /> The difference is in the way they display data. `main_v1.py` uses Entry widget to display data which wasn't much convenient plus there was no y-scroll!! (*OMG no y-scroll?! Not good for large amout of records* &nbsp;&nbsp;(TT_TT)&nbsp;) and `main.py` uses Treeview widget which is more conveient and has got a y-scroll! (*yay now I can see large amount of records!*)
